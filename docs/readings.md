# Readings

Longer-form writing such as blog post series, handbooks, and tutorials. Good when you've got spare time or want to get more background info.


## "How does the web work": HTTP, CORS, and DNS

Foundational information on how the web works. Often not covered in coursework so providing it here!

-  http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/http-basics/ and http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/http-headers/
	-  Read both. Skim if you know some stuff.
	-  It explains some stuff about URLs, HTTP, etc 
-  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
	-  If you know HTTP basics, this is the next to read. As a frontend dev you'll constantly see errors regarding CORS, may as well know what that is!
-  https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/dns/what-is-dns/
	- The `What are the steps in a DNS lookup?` in particular, the rest is getting too into the weeds imo (but read if interested!)


## Language or Technology-Specific Tutorials and Reading

-  Typescript Handbook https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
  - reading this whole thing would be useful for anyone who knows some Javascript already
  - However it doesn't incorporate a tutorial so it may be a bit dry. I'd just recommend you read a bit at a time and eventually you'll make it through (I'm still working through it!)'
-  GraphQL Tutorial https://graphql.org/learn/
   -  Hasura and many of our projets will use GraphQL so good to lay a foundation
   -  I'd recommend getting an initial


- https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/
	- Good tutorial for Hasura, but it kind of zips past the JS stuff.
	- Also covers a bit of authentication
-  React JS 
	- Note: Ask James E and Ana about Pluralsight for React if these aren't great or if you can't find a good tutorial and want one.
	  This section is tricky as I got into React late into my webdev career so I had difficulty picking a _good_ resource for this.
	- A promising looking one, but it's paid at some point. If it's fantastic after you get through the free stuff let us know and we can look into paying for it. https://react-tutorial.app/

  - [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) publishes detailed in-depth articles. Here are some recommended articles to checkout:
