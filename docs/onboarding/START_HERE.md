# Training Program

v0.5.1-beta

I'm moving all our onboarding resources into this folder as markdown files as a pseudo-github wiki (but when you clone the repo you get it too!)

## Goals of this Folder of Docs

As people are working remote more and touchpoints become further apart, along with my schedule becoming more crowded, it's difficult to sprinkle knowledge organically to new devs as we encounter issues day-to-day. In particular, I am on holiday when work begins in January.

To that end, I want to compile a lot of information in a document to hand-off when someone starts off. This is the first version of that document, and I think ideally I'd like to move it to Github after this version so one can download it and provide improvements!


The primary goals of this document are:

- To turn much of the knowledge I, James Firth, normally provide as it comes up as a document as my schedule doesn't look like it will allow as much time to sprinkle the knowledge as I'd like.
- To provide a list of quality reference materials both that I frequently use myself or I think will be useful early in careers.
- To compile a list of useful readings for background technologies that often aren't discussed in detail in coursework.
- To give tips and goals that aren't strictly programming related.


That said, use what you have available! Use search engines like Google, ask each other, or myself. We could even make a "newbies" channel if that would help.
